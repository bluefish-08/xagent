"""Pins where a terminal-frame ``code`` argument is allowed to come from.

``create_terminal_task_error_event``'s own runtime gate only checks the
*value* of ``code`` (a member of the closed set, and nothing else) -- it has
no way to know whether that value came from a curated projector or from an
incidental string a future caller happened to have on hand. This test closes
that gap statically: every call site that passes ``code=`` must bind it, in
the same function, from a call to ``connector_runtime_client_code`` -- the
one function in this repository that projects an exception onto a
client-visible code. Anything else (a literal, ``str(exc)``, a field read off
the exception directly) is an unauthorized source, even if the value it
produces happens to be a real closed-set member today.

The second test pins the other way a code reaches the frame: a caller
asserting it through ``asserted_code=``.
