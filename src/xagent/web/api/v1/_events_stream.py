"""SSE transport layer for ``GET /v1/chat/tasks/{task_id}/events``.

This module owns everything about *moving bytes to the client and
deciding when to stop* -- registration into the shared connection
``manager``, the outbound frame queue, the 30-second watchdog, the
1-hour absolute duration cap, and per-task / per-principal concurrency
limits. It emits four lifecycle events -- ``task.status``,
``task.completed``, ``task.input_required``, and ``stream.error`` --
and nothing else.

Explicitly out of scope here:
  - Projecting ``step.*`` / ``message.*`` content from trace events.
  - Buffering live frames during attach warm-up, or reconciling frame
    order at all. No ``task.status`` frame is ever guaranteed to be
    fresh or in order: ``ConnectionManager.broadcast_to_task`` stamps
    each event with whatever ``run_id`` / ``state_version`` tuple its
    producer captured, falling back to a fresh read of the task row
    (status included) when the producer didn't capture one, and this
    sink never compares that stamp against anything -- it just forwards
    each status string it sees, deduped only against the last one it
    sent. A stale or out-of-order
    ``task.status`` frame can therefore reach the client at any point
    during the stream's life, not only right after attach. This is
    accepted: the only frames this module treats as authoritative are
    the three close frames -- ``task.completed``, ``task.input_required``,
    and ``stream.error`` -- and all three are produced by the watchdog
    (or the attach-time snapshot read) reading the task row directly,
    never inferred from frame ordering.
  - Populating ``task.input_required``'s ``prompt`` field from the
    agent's question text. Only the watchdog closes the stream on a
    task stuck waiting for user input (within one watchdog cycle), and
    it always sends ``prompt: null`` -- question-text sniffing from
    live frames belongs to the content-projection layer, not this
    transport layer.

Sink instances duck-type the ``websocket.ConnectionManager`` connection
contract (an object with an async ``send_text(str)`` method) so they
register into the *same* shared ``manager`` real WebSocket connections
use, and ride the same ``broadcast_to_task`` fan-out.

    ``aclose()`` with no frames read) is guaranteed to reach the
    ``finally`` and clean up exactly what it reserved.
